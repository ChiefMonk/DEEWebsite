							<h2>Classical Reasoning</h2>
							<p>
								<i>Knowledge representation and reasoning</i> involves the expression of reasoning using formal languages known 
								as <i>logics</i>. Although there are numerous types of logics, our primary focus lies in <i>propositional logic</i>. 
								<i>Classical propositional</i> logic serves as the foundational framework for extending to KLM-style 
								defeasible reasoning.
							</p>
								<p>
								In classical propositional logic, we represent entities, like <i>animals</i> and <i>pets</i>, 
								as propositional atoms, and we utilize logical connectives to construct more intricate statements, 
								which we refer to as formulas. Through the concept of entailment, we can deduce new knowledge from the 
								existing pool of knowledge.
								<img src="kbs/kb2.png" class="equation" style="max-height: 50px;">
										
								A group of statements is labeled as a <i>knowledge base, K,</i> as it encapsulates the 
								knowledge we have formalized. Building an information repository in the form of a knowledge base 
								and employing classical entailment for information deduction, as illustrated earlier, 
								furnishes us with a straightforward reasoning system.
							
							</p>
							<p>
								Classical reasoning is in many ways the foundation for more advanced forms of 
								reasoning such as KLM-style defeasible propositional logic. 								
							</p>
							<h2>Explanation</h2>
							<p>
								Occasionally, we seek to understand the underlying reasons for the validity of certain entailments. 
								In classical logic, <i>explanation</i> provide insight into which statements within our knowledge base are 
								accountable for a specific entailment. Our research primarily concentrates on a type of explanation termed 
								<i>justification</i>, which consists of the essential subsets of statements enabling us to draw a particular 
								conclusion.								
							</p>
								<p>
								For example, suppose we know the unrelated information that <i>'animals can hunt'</i>:
								<img src="kbs/kb3.png" class="equation" style="max-height: 45px;">
								The entailment that <i>'pets can hunt'</i> for the knowledge base above then has the justification								
								<img src="kbs/kb4.png" class="equation" style="max-height: 45px;">

								because this represents the concept of providing "just enough" information to support the inference that 
								<i>'pets can hunt'</i>. It demonstrates how justifications align with how people typically explain their 
								reasoning for inferences. In such a context, we wouldn't normally assert <i>'animals are wild'</i> when 
								providing a rationale for why <i>'pets can hunt'</i>.								
							</p>
							<p>
								<i>Explanations</i> have proven to be a critical component of reasoning systems. 
								This concept is especially valuable for debugging knowledge bases, 
								and it has also been demonstrated to enhance user understanding and 
								confidence in reasoning systems. Consequently, they constitute an 
								essential element in the practical application of reasoning systems, 
								underscoring their significance in extending to defeasible reasoning.
