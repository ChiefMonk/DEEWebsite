							<h2>Defeasible Reasoning</h2>
							<p>
								Classical reasoning can pose limitations as it struggles to effectively represent statements that
								<i>typically</i> hold true but may have occasional exceptions. For instance, when we aim for a more precise 
								 model of pets, we might incorporate the statement <i>'pets are not wild'</i> into the knowledge base:
								 <img src="kbs/kb5.png" class="equation" style="max-height: 45px;">
								
								 Given the conflicting inferences that arise, such as the conclusion that <i>'pets are wild'</i> and that <i>'pets are not wild'</i>,
								 which is inherently contradictory, classical reasoning leads to the 
								 untenable assertion that pets cannot exist. In essence, it undermines our capacity to engage in 
								 meaningful reasoning about pets. What we truly intend to convey is that 'animals are <i>typically</i> wild', 
								 and then specify that pets represent a distinct category of animals that do not fall into the wild category. 
								 <i>Defeasible reasoning</i> offers a way to handle this inherent uncertainty, enabling a more precise description 
								 of pets:							
								<img src="kbs/kb6.png" class="equation" style="max-height: 45px;">

								Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor introduced the KLM approach for defeasible reasoning, 
								characterized by a set of declarative properties. Our attention is directed toward 
								the KLM extension applied to propositional logic. Just as classical entailment 
								facilitated inferences from classical knowledge, concepts of <i>defeasible entailment</i> 
								empower us to engage in reasoning concerning defeasible knowledge. 
								Among these, the most elementary and widely recognized notion within the 
								KLM framework is <i>Rational Closure</i>.								
							</p>
							<p>
								In a straightforward manner, <i>Rational Closure</i> attains defeasible reasoning by establishing a 
								hierarchy of statements based on their typicality. General statements are assigned lower ranks,
								 while specific statements receive higher ranks. This process can be envisioned as dividing the 
								 knowledge base into distinct levels:								
								<img src="kbs/kb7.png" class="equation" style="max-height: 165px;">

								Considering that pets represent a unique and exceptional subset within the 
								category of birds, statements pertaining to pets hold a higher ranking than 
								those related to animals. Classical, unequivocal information is assigned a distinct 
								rank, represented as âˆž. This ranking scheme allows us to deduce conclusions by 
								progressively discarding the statements with the lowest rank until classical 
								contradictions no longer exist. For instance, given that the entire knowledge base 
								categorically suggests that pets cannot exist, we eliminate the lowest-ranked 
								statements when engaging in reasoning about pets.
								
								<img src="kbs/kb8.png" class="equation" style="max-height: 167px;">

								With the absence of any lingering classical inconsistencies concerning pets,
								 we can employ classical reasoning on the remaining statements to engage in 
								 defeasible reasoning regarding pets.								
							</p>
							<p>
								While it may not be immediately apparent from this context, Rational Closure characterizes a rather 
								cautious approach to reasoning, as it frequently discards more information than required. 
								In contrast, <i>Relevant</i> and <i>Lexicographic Closure</i> are two distinct methods that share similar principles 
								but are designed to preserve a greater amount of information, resulting in a less cautious form of reasoning.
